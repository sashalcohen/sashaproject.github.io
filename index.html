					<span class="emphasize-letter">W</span>e live in a digital world, a world in which Americans rely on the internet to live, to work, to connect. But as our reliance on the internet has grown, a familiar pattern has emerged: historically marginalized communities often lack the technology and infrastructure necessary to access high-speed internet—and all the opportunities that come with it.

					In the South Bronx Zip Code 10454, for example, nearly a third of households lack access to the internet. The median household income for that same ZIP code is $26,400—one of the lowest median area incomes of any ZIP code in the city. Similar patterns are evident across the South Bronx, where median household incomes tend to be low, and the percentage of households that lack internet access are high. In the Manhattan ZIP code 10069, by contrast, which covers parts of the Upper West Side, only 3.9 percent of households lack internet access. The median household income in that area is close to $200,000.

				<p class="article-text">
					There is a visible disparity in internet access between upper and lower Manhattan as well. The ZIP code area 10029, which marks the end of the Upper East Side and the beginning of Spanish Harlem, has a median household income of $35,640—the lowest in all of Manhattan. 22 percent of households in that neighborhood have no access to the internet. In the ZIP code area directly to the South, where the median household income is $137,000, only 9.8 percent of households lack internet access—less than half that of its Northern neighbors.
				</p>

				<p class="article-text">
					Though this inequity is often understood in simple terms: people with more money can afford wifi; low-income people cannot. But there is an oft overlooked infrastructural component to this evident disparity. Broadband internet access is distributed through telecom poles, poles which are built by franchises like Verizon and AT&T. With a vested interest in maintaining their bottom lines, these companies often neglect low-income communities, making it more difficult for people of every socio-economic status living in these areas to access broadband internet service.
